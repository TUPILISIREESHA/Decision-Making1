           Color detection

1.QUESTION:
Dr. Dexter is a Robotics Research Scientist. He is now on the urge of building his own humanoid robot - Xinyou. 

Xinyou has an in-built color sensor. The sensor senses the environment and gives the color that is highly present in the spectrum. Now, Dr. Dexter wants Xinyou to output whether it is dawn or dusk based on the sensor's output. The sensor outputs 'BLUE' or 'RED'. If color blue is scattered more it is Dawn and if red is scattered more it is Dusk. 

Any input other than 'BLUE' and 'RED' is assumed to be an invalid input. 

Write a program that finds out whether it is Dawn or Dusk.


INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Input is a string.
Output is a string, either "It is Dawn", "It is Dusk", or "Invalid Input".
Refer to the sample input & output for formatting specifications.
 
SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 1:
BLUE
It is Dawn  
 
SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 2:
GREEN
Invalid Input 

Code:
a=str(input())
if a=='BLUE':
    print("It is Dawn")
elif a=='RED':
    print("It is Dusk")
else:
        print("Invalid Input")

2.QUESTION:
Xinyou has an in-built GPS system that gives its current position coordinates as input. Using these coordinates Xinyou gets the current weather information. Initially, Dr. Dexter wants Xinyou to drive only when it is sunny. The different weather conditions are 'sunny', 'rainy', and 'foggy'.

Given the weather condition, write a program to check whether Xinyou can drive or not.
 
INPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of a string, corresponding to the weather condition.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Output is a string "Yes I can drive smile" or "Sorry invalid input :|" or "No I cant drive sad".
Refer to the sample input and output for formatting specifications. 
SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 1:
sunny

              Toll pass
5.QUESTION:

Dr. Dexter regularly visits his only friend Dr. Lee. Dr. Lee lives in a city named Nakuto. In order to get to Nakuto, Dr. Dexter has to take National Highways (NH  999). NH 999 has a toll booth where the toll passes are categorized as One-way pass, Two-way pass, and Monthly pass.
If Dr. Dexter travels to Nakuto and doesn't return the same day, a one-way pass would do better. If he travels to Nakuto and returns to his hometown the same day, a two-way pass is economical. One-way passes cost $O, two-way passes cost $T and monthly-passes cost $M. In a month, Dr. Dexter plans to travel 'x' times to Nakuto and stays there, travel 'y' times to Nakuto and returns home the same day. He wants Xinyou to know whether a combination of one-way and two-way passes would be economical or a monthly pass would be economical. 

Write a program module that finds out whether he ought to take a monthly-pass or a combination of one-way and two-way passes.
 
INPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of 5 lines.
The first line of input is an integer 'x', which corresponds to the sum of the number of times Dr. Dexter travels only to Nakuto and doesn't return back in a day and the number of times he travels to his home town from Nakuto without a two-way pass.
The second line of input is an integer 'y', which corresponds to the number of times Dr. Dexter travels to Nakuto and returns back to his hometown the same day.
The third line of input is a floating point number 'o', which corresponds to the cost of a one-way pass.
The fourth line of input is a floating point number 't', which corresponds to the cost of a two-way pass.
The fifth line of input is a floating point number 'm', which corresponds to the cost of a monthly pass.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output consists of a string, "Monthly Pass" or "Invalid Input" or "One way pass + Two way pass".
Refer to the sample input and output for formatting specifications. 
Note: When the combination of one-way and two-way pass equals monthly pass, Dr.Dexter prefers monthly pass.

               Petrol bunks

7.QUESTION:

Dr. Dexter has now started his trip to Shinyao. Unfortunately, he has forgotten about the fuel. There are two gas bunks on the way to Shinyao, 'A' and 'B'. As soon as his car reaches the bunk A, it runs out of fuel. Bunks A and B are 'd' miles apart. Xinyou, the robot finds out from statistics that one of the bunks provides the best quality fuel. They decide on filling the best quality fuel.
Write a program module that finds the quantity of fuel that has to be filled at bunks A and B.
 
INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input is an integer d (0 <  d < 32767), which corresponds to the distance between bunks A and B
The second line of input is an integer s (0 <  s < 32767), whcih corresponds to the distance between bunk A and Shinyao.
The third line of input is a floating point number 'm' corresponding to the mileage Dr.Dexter's car yields.
The fourth line of input is the character 'b' corresponding to the bunk that provides the best quality fuel. Assume that b takes values either 'A' or 'B'
Assume that bunk A lies before bunk B.
